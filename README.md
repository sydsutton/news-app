# Andrew's News App

I used the New York Times API to build this app. If you clone this repo, you will not be able to run it locally without your own unique api key.

You can search for and view news articles without signin up and logging in, but in order to save any news articles, you must sign up and log in. Firebase is in charge of storing and validating log in information. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `git clone {repo url}`
### `yarn add`
### `yarn start`
